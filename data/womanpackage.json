            "description": "PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) is diagnosed through a combination of medical history, blood tests, and ultrasound. Doctors look for irregular periods, elevated androgen levels, and the presence of multiple small cysts in the ovaries through a pelvic ultrasound. Blood tests check for hormone imbalances and insulin resistance. Symptoms like weight gain, acne, and excessive hair growth are also evaluated. Early detection of PCOD is important for managing symptoms and preventing complications such as diabetes and infertility.",

Key tests include blood tests to measure hormone levels, check for insulin resistance, and rule out other conditions like thyroid disorders. A pelvic ultrasound is often used to detect multiple cysts on the ovaries, a common sign of PCOS. Doctors may also assess symptoms like irregular periods, excess hair growth, and acne. Diagnosis typically follows the Rotterdam Criteria, requiring two of three indicators: irregular periods, elevated androgens, or polycystic ovaries. Early diagnosis helps manage symptoms and prevent complications.",

During this time, maintaining optimal health is crucial for both the mother and the developing baby. A balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, including folic acid, iron, calcium, and protein, supports the growth and development of the fetus while keeping the mother healthy. Regular prenatal check-ups are essential to monitor the progress of the pregnancy, screen for potential complications, and provide necessary interventions.",

It typically includes a variety of tests and screenings designed to detect potential health issues early, even before symptoms appear. This is especially beneficial for individuals between the ages of 30 and 45, as it can help identify and manage health risks that tend to increase with age.",
